Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department. My interests lie at an intersection of deep learning, Bayesian inference, and statistics, with the goal of developing robust and reliable algorithms for spatial and temporal reasoning.

I am currently a member of the [Space Telecommunications, Astronomy, and Radiation (STAR) Lab](https://starlab.mit.edu/), advised by Professor Kerri Cahoy. In August 2023, I completed my master's degree at MIT advised by John W. Fisher III, as a member of the [Sensing, Learning, and Inference (SLI) Group](https://sli.csail.mit.edu/). Previously, in May 2021, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I received the [Love Family Foundation Award](https://loveaward.oue.gatech.edu/past-recipients/).
