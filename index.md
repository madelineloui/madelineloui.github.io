Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department. My interests lie at an intersection of deep learning, Bayesian inference, and statistics, with the goal of developing robust and reliable algorithms for spatial and temporal reasoning.

I am currently a member of the Space Telecommunications, Astronomy, and Radiation (STAR) Lab, advised by Professor Kerri Cahoy, in which we are researching machine learning algorithms to enhance satellite capabilities for collecting high quality and relevant data to aid in climate monitoring and science exploration. In August 2023, I completed my master's degree at MIT advised by John W. Fisher III, as a member of the Sensing, Learning, and Inference (SLI) Group. My master's thesis involved analyzing a method of unsupervised nonparametric multi-modal data fusion for audio-visual data and developing a significance testing framework to assess the learned structure. Previously, in May 2021, I received a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I received the [Love Family Foundation Award](https://loveaward.oue.gatech.edu/past-recipients/).
